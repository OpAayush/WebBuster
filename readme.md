# WebBuster

**WebBuster** is a chaotic, troll website designed for pure fun and browser mayhem. It intentionally abuses browser APIs, spams popups, blasts sounds, and unleashes a barrage of visual effects‚Äîoften to the point of crashing your browser. This is not a normal website: it's a digital prank and a test of browser resilience.
